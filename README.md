### Introduction <br>
In this analysis, I plan to explore how the Covid-19 pandemic and the mask mandate impacted the job market (unemployment rate) of Maricopa County, Arizona. I also want to see how another county with a similar population - Cook County in Illinois, is doing compared to Maricopa County. (Maricopa, AZ has a population of 4.485 million while Cook, IL has a population of 5.15 million.) Furthermore, I want to compare the situation in Maricopa County and that in the whole Arizona State.

It comes down to the three following research questions.
- Research Question #1
  - What does the pandemic situation look like in Maricopa County vs Cook County? (Infection rate, daily cases) What about the estimated mask prevalence in those counties?
  - Hypothesis: Maricopa County has a higher infection rate and significantly more cases than Cook County. The estimated mask prevalence in Maricopa County is lower than that in Cook County.
- Research Question #2
  - How was the unemployment rate in Maricopa County affected by the pandemic? What about Cook County?
  - Hypothesis: Every 10% increase in infection rate would result in a 1% increase in unemployment in Maricopa County, Arizona. The number would be lower for Cook County, Illinois.
- Research Question #3
  - One of the major metropolitan areas - Phoenix, is in Maricopa County, Arizona. What does the infection rate look like in Maricopa County compared to the rest of Arizona? What about the unemployment rate? Which areaâ€™s unemployment rate is more sensitive to the pandemic?
  - Hypothesis: The infection rate is lower in Maricopa County compared to the rest of Arizona State. The unemployment rate is lower in Maricopa County compared to that of Arizona State. The unemployment rate in Maricopa County is less sensitive to the pandemic.
